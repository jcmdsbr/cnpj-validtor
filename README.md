## Description :books:

- Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

### CNPJ Algorithm :bulb:

The CNPJ is composed of fourteen digits, divided into three blocks:

- the first, which represents the registration number itself;
- the second, located after the bar, which represents a unique code for the head office or branch;
- the third, represented by the two values called check digits (DV).
- The check digits (DV) are created from the first twelve. The calculation is done in two steps using the division module 11.
